[{"categories":["Gulag"],"content":"In our times, we are often surrounded by a series of untrue and fabricated information. However, art and literature provide a platform for retaliation, a pure space where truth and history can be unveiled. As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said during his acceptance of the Nobel Prize in Literature: The simple act of an ordinary brave man is not to participate in lies, not to support false actions! His rule: Let that come into the world, let it even reign supreme—only not through me. But it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more: to defeat the lie! For in the struggle with lies art has always triumphed and shall always triumph! Visibly, irrefutably for all! Lies can prevail against much in this world, but never against art. Under the authoritarian rule of the Soviet Union, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn personally experienced the harsh environment of the Gulag labor camps. Through the creation of ‘The Gulag Archipelago’, he bravely exposed the brutality and inhumanity of that period, using the power of literature to reveal the atrocities and truths of that era to the world. The same script is unfolding on the land of China today. We hope that through the works collected under the category of ‘Gulag’, we can show everyone that even in the darkest moments, art and literature have the power to unveil the truth, showcasing the possibility of recovery and regeneration of human nature. We hope to inspire more people to join this movement, using art and truth as our tools to unite against the widespread lies and deceit in this world.
