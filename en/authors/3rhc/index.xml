            </div><p>In our times, we are often surrounded by a series of untrue and fabricated information. However, art and literature provide a platform for retaliation, a pure space where truth and history can be unveiled. As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said during his acceptance of the Nobel Prize in Literature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simple act of an ordinary brave man is not to participate in lies, not to support false actions! His rule: Let that come into the world, let it even reign supremeâ€”only not through me. But it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more: to defeat the lie! For in the struggle with lies art has always triumphed and shall always triumph! Visibly, irrefutably for all! Lies can prevail against much in this world, but never against art.</p>
